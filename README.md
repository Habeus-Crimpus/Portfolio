# Summary of the Projects 

* 😈 The **Dark Triad Classification App (Python)** offers supervised machine learning predictions and dynamic data visualizations about levels of agreement with questions used to measure narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. 
* 🧗🏻‍♂️ The **IFSC Classification Report (R)** summarizes the development of a random forest classification model that predicts with +90% accuracy whether a rock climbing athlete should be considered a potential winner of an International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) competition.
* 🎬 The **Movie Recommender Project (R)** covers my work on the Netflix challenge, where Netflix offered a prize for developing a recommendation system that performed better than their own. The report includes a model that performed 9.6% better than Netflix's (then) algorithm.
* 🦄 The **Analysis of Unicorn Companies (PostgreSQL)** is a brief exploratory data analysis report of unicorn companies between 2019-2021.
* 😃 The **CPI vs. Happiness Dashboard (Tableau)** provides interactive map, numeric, and scatter plot-based exploratory data analysis of economic, social, and political data in relation to reported happiness across various countries.
